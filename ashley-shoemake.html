        <p>Ashley Shoemake is a graphic designer graduating with her Bachelor’s of Science in Design from Arizona State
          University. From a young age, she discovered a love for working with her hands and creating something out of
          nothing. Her passion for craft comes with a curiosity with the ways in which people communicate with each
          other. She hopes to one day translate these loves into meaningful work by designing within the realm of social
          activism. In her free time, Ashley can be found designing and creating embroidery projects, taking care of her
          14
          houseplants (and counting), and playing cozy video games.

        <h2>Life After Incarceration</h2>
        <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="social-bio-body">
        <p>The United States’ prison system is notorious for having the highest level of incarceration in the world.
          Thanks to the media and popular culture, many people are aware of the atrocities that happen within the prison
          walls. However, what is our society’s understanding of the effects that follow the released prisoners?
        </p> <br>
        <p>Those who have been incarcerated not only have their rights diminished, but their psyches permanently
          damaged, their financial hardships amplified, and their relationships with families and communities are
          strained. It’s past time for Americans to reconsider the infrastructure of incarceration in this country. The
          journey begins with the education of the public, and continues by reimagining the ways in which we can divest
          from punishment, and invest in the overall wellness of our citizens and communities. </p>
