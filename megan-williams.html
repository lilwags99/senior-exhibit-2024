      <div class="social-bio-body">
        <p>Fast Fashion is devastating our planet through significant negative impacts on the environment, labor
          practices, and society. Our water, land, and air are becoming so polluted that we are reaching a point of no
          return. </p><br>
          <p>These companies are producing clothing with chemicals and materials so toxic that they cannot be
          broken down or reused, the clothing dyes are seeping into our own water systems poisoning our drinking water,
          the clothes that cannot be recycled have to be burned, and all of these cheap clothing items are made by
          abused workers, many of which are women and children. Thrifting and recycling cannot fix this problem. We have
          to make these companies be held accountable through action and laws that prevent the blatant disregard for
          life in all forms.</p>
